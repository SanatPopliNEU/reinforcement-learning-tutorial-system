### Core Components

1. **Tutorial Orchestrator**: Coordinates multiple agents and manages session flow
2. **Content Agent (DQN)**: Optimizes question selection and content delivery
3. **Strategy Agent (PPO)**: Manages high-level teaching strategies and adaptation
4. **Tutoring Environment**: Simulates realistic student interactions and learning
5. **Student Simulator**: Models diverse student behaviors and learning patterns

## Reinforcement Learning Implementation

### 1. Value-Based Learning (DQN)

**Purpose**: Content selection and question sequencing optimization

**Implementation Details**:
- **Network Architecture**: 4-layer fully connected neural network (256 hidden units)
- **Experience Replay**: 10,000 experience buffer with batch learning
- **Target Network**: Separate target network updated every 100 steps
- **Exploration**: ε-greedy strategy with decay (ε: 1.0 → 0.01)

**State Space (15 dimensions)**:
- Student profile features (learning rate, attention span, motivation, fatigue)
- Performance metrics (consecutive successes/failures, engagement)
- Knowledge levels across subjects
- Current question context

**Action Space**:
- Ask Question
- Provide Hint
- Explain Concept
- Review Previous Material

**Reward Function**:
```python
reward = base_reward + engagement_bonus + knowledge_growth_bonus
where:
- base_reward = +10 (correct), -5 (incorrect)
- engagement_bonus = engagement_level * 5
- knowledge_growth_bonus = learning_progress * 15
```

### 2. Policy Gradient Methods (PPO)

**Purpose**: Strategic teaching adaptation and motivation management

**Implementation Details**:
- **Actor-Critic Architecture**: Shared backbone with separate policy and value heads
- **Clipping**: PPO clip ratio of 0.2 for stable learning
- **GAE**: Generalized Advantage Estimation (λ = 0.95)
- **Batch Updates**: 2048 experience buffer with 4 epochs per update

**Enhanced State Space (23 dimensions)**:
- Base environment state (15 dimensions)
- Strategy-specific features:
  - Recent adaptation trends
  - Content effectiveness metrics
  - Learning pattern analysis

**Action Space**:
- Increase Difficulty
- Decrease Difficulty
- Provide Encouragement
- Suggest Break

**Value Function**:
Estimates long-term learning outcomes based on current teaching strategy.

## Agent Coordination

### Coordination Strategies

#### 1. Hierarchical Coordination (Recommended)
```python
if strategic_intervention_needed():
    action = strategy_agent.select_action()
else:
    action = content_agent.select_action()
```

**Triggers for Strategic Intervention**:
- Low engagement (< 0.4)
- Poor content effectiveness (< 0.3)
- Every 5 time steps (regular check-in)

#### 2. Competitive Coordination
Both agents propose actions; selection based on value estimates and current context.

#### 3. Collaborative Coordination
Weighted combination of agent recommendations based on current student needs.

### Coordination Benefits

- **Specialization**: Each agent focuses on specific aspects of tutoring
- **Robustness**: Multiple perspectives on optimal actions
- **Adaptability**: Dynamic switching based on student state
- **Learning Efficiency**: Specialized reward signals for each agent

## Technical Components

### Environment Design

**Student Simulator**:
```python
class StudentProfile:
    learning_rate: float      # How quickly student learns (0-1)
    attention_span: float     # Focus duration capability (0-1)
    motivation: float         # Current motivation level (0-1)
    knowledge_levels: dict    # Subject-specific knowledge (0-1)
    mistake_tendency: float   # Likelihood of errors (0-1)
```

**Dynamic Student Behavior**:
- Fatigue accumulation over session

**Adaptive Selection**:
Questions selected based on:
- Current knowledge level
- Recent performance
- Engagement state
- Difficulty progression strategy

### Reward Engineering

**Multi-Objective Optimization**:
- **Learning Outcomes**: Knowledge growth and retention
- **Engagement**: Maintaining student interest and motivation
- **Efficiency**: Optimal use of session time
- **Personalization**: Adaptation to individual learning styles

**Reward Components**:
```python
total_reward = (
    performance_reward +           # ±10 points
    engagement_bonus +             # 0-5 points
    knowledge_growth_bonus +       # 0-15 points
    efficiency_bonus +             # 0-3 points
